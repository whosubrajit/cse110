The conditions are as follows:-
i. Must begin with letters (A-Z, a-z), dollar sign ($) or underscore ( _ ). 
ii. Can not start with numbers or special characters.
iii. Can have numbers except at the start (0-9).

a. hungry - It's valid.
b. 2AB - It's invalid for having a number at the start. 
c. 312.2 - It's invalid for having a number at the start. 
d. MOBILE - It's valid.
e. “Ans” - It's invalid because only $ and _ signs are valid at the start.
f. $30 - It's valid.
g. Yes/No - It's invalid because only $ and _ signs are allowed as special characters.
h. student-id - It's invalid because only $ and _ signs are allowed as special characters.
i. A+3 - It's invalid because only $ and _ signs are allowed as special characters.
j. ‘X’ - It's invalid because only $ and _ signs are valid at the start.
